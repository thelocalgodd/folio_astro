I started off not knowing shit about fuckk. But eventually, I found my way.
<br> <br>
Ok, first things first, as said on my about page, I was expecting to get admission to read Electrical Engineering at KNUST, but for some reason, I got Computer Science, which I now believe was for the best.
<br><br>
Fast forward, to first year, first semester, I took a course, Introduction to Structured Programming, CSM 157, and this program was supposed to ease us into programming, using pseudocode and whatnot, and I knew we'd be doing C++ the following semester, so I decided to get a headstart, I looked up tutorials and eventually, I stuck with the w3schools.com tutorial, I loved it, I was learning it everywhere, and I totally enjoyed learning the basics of C++, this helped me understand CSM 157 better and ultimately, made me a little bit better at programming.
<br><br>
There was a set of 49 questions by Dr. Hafron going around by then, I remember every morning, I used to solve a question, or at least I tried to, and then upload it to my github, I attempted most of the questions, solved less than half, and eventually just abandoned the rest.
<br><br>
Fast forward (again), it was second semester, and all what I'd learnt in first semester was being repeated in class. I remember very clearly, Dr. Hayfron covered the whole basics of C++ in 2 hours at SCB-TF1, and that was basically it, the graduate assistant took over, and that was it till the end of the semester. It wasn't all tooo bad (it was). But it was alright, I aced the exam, and I was proud of myself because I worked hard and it paid off. 
<br><br>
Ok, now I guess, the whole point of this little story is that:
<br>
*. Learning ahead is great, do it if you can. It will go a long was to help (literally).
<br>
*. Fall in love with coding, make sure you develop an interest for what you're doing if you really want it to work for you, I know that's what I did, and it's working out great.
