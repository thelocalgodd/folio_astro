                Here are a few words about me, 
                and my past, I may or may not 
                have more in my blog.

                I was born and bred in 
                a small town in Ghana, 
                West Africa. I am highly
                motivated to do great things.
                
                I love memes and anime, and of
                course, I love to learn new
                and interesting things.`

                here is a little something about me, 
                I started coding getting to the end 
                of semester one in 2023, I had just 
                started a four year course in 
                Computer Science, I was expecting to
                 pursue Electrical Engineering, 
                 but it did not work out (now I 
                 believe it was probably for the 
                 best).
                 \n
                 I was taking Introduction to Structured 
                 Programming in first sem and had to learn
                 C++ the following sem, so I took it upon 
                 myself to get a head start,  I hopped on 
                 to w3schools and learned the basics of c++ 
                 and it was a walkover in the end.
                 \n
                 anyway, a few months later, here I am. 
                 Glory to God for all the great things he 
                 has done. 🧑‍🍳`
